# Multisig Policy FHE: A DeFi Protocol for Encrypted Spending Policies

Multisig Policy FHE revolutionizes asset management by introducing a DeFi protocol for multi-signature wallets that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This innovative solution enables organizations and DAOs to implement encrypted spending policies, ensuring that sensitive financial controls remain confidential while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

In the evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), managing assets securely is crucial for organizations. Traditional multi-signature wallet configurations often expose spending policies and control logic, which can lead to vulnerabilities or unintended information leaks. The lack of privacy in transaction approval processes can compromise the integrity of a DAO's internal controls, potentially putting assets at risk to external threats. There is a pressing need for tools that not only enhance security but also protect sensitive information from prying eyes.

## The FHE Solution

This project addresses the need for enhanced privacy in multi-signature wallets through the implementation of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using **Zama's open-source libraries**. By integrating Zama's technology, we can encrypt expenditure rules, like "only two signatures are needed for transactions below $10,000, and four for those above," without disclosing the specifics to external observers. This ensures that the operational logic remains invisible while still allowing authorized parties to execute transactions seamlessly.

The FHE capabilities of Zama's libraries, such as **Concrete**, enable confidential computations, thus ensuring that the internal financial control processes of any organization or DAO using this protocol are secure and private. 

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encrypted Spending Policies:** All spending rules are encrypted, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interpret the conditions.
- **Homomorphic Signature Verification:** Ensures that signatures required for transactions can be validated without exposing sensitive transaction details.
- **Visibility Control:** Protects the inner workings of an organization's financial policies from external scrutiny.
- **Enhanced Security:** Greatly increases asset protection by ensuring that transactions can only be executed by pre-defined criteria without revealing these rules to the public.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**
- **Node.js**
- **Hardhat/Foundry**
- **Solidity** for smart contract development

## Installation Guide

To set up the Multisig Policy FHE project, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will fetch the necessary Zama FHE libraries among other dependencies.

**Note:** Please do not use `git clone` or any URLs to download the project. Download the project files manually.

## Build & Run Guide

After completing the installation, you can build and run the project with the following commands:

### Compile Smart Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy the Contract

You can deploy the contract to your desired network with:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```

### Example Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using the following example code snippet, which demonstrates how to set up a multi-signature spending policy:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const MultisigPolicy = await ethers.getContractFactory("Multisig_Policy_Fhe");
    const multisigPolicy = await MultisigPolicy.deploy(/* constructor arguments if needed */);

    await multisigPolicy.deployed();
    console.log("Multisig Policy deployed to:", multisigPolicy.address);

    // Example to add an encrypted spending policy
    const encryptedPolicy = await multisigPolicy.createSpendingPolicy(
        "0x...", // FHE encrypted policy parameters
        2, // number of signatures for small transactions
        4  // number of signatures for large transactions
    );
    console.log("Spending policy created:", encryptedPolicy);
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```
